# ‚ú® Release Highlight

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Button

Previous to this release, there had been hack ways to use download functionality within Streamlit, but none of these were great for general use - notably most didn't play well with the [Streamlit Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud). With `st.download_button` you can now seamlessly use download functionality both locally and with on our cloud platform. Want to play with some samples? Check out the radio buttons in the sidebar!

**Error Scenarios**
- Raise exception when download button used inside form
